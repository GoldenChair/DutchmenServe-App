# Information

This repo contains the work of students at LVC and myself up until the time I graduated the school and stopped working on the project. As it stands it is unfinished and mostly nonfunctional.

# DutchmenServe

This Flutter application is a way for LVC students to upload their community service hours into a searchable database for community organizers and LVC staff.
This app also provides a way for these students to find and join community service events and organizations.
